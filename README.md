- [Vibration of rolling bearings under widely varying speed conditions](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/6k6fbzc6vv/1]): This dataset contains observations of vibration of test stand under widely varying speed conditions.
- [Bearing Vibration Data under Time-varying Rotational Speed Conditions](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/v43hmbwxpm/1): The data contain vibration signals collected from bearings of different health conditions under time-varying rotational speed conditions. 
- [Planetary gearbox vibration data](https://researchdata.up.ac.za/articles/dataset/Planetary_gearbox_vibration_data/13476525)
- [CONDITION MONITORING FOR HANDPUMPS - VIBRATION DATA](https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/condition-monitoring-handpumps-vibration-data)
- [Unbalance Classification Using Vibration Data (Vibration Measurements on a Rotating Shaft at Different Unbalance Strengths)](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/unbalance-classification-using-vibration-data): This dataset contains vibration data recorded on a rotating drive train. This drive train consists of an electronically commutated DC motor and a shaft driven by it, which passes through a roller bearing.
